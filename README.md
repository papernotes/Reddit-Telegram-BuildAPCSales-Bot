A practice bot that looks through Reddit's /r/buildapcsales posts and saves submissions with ratings greater than a certain threshold


# Example Usage
    python buildapcsales.py
    (input username and password)
The resulting output to terminal will be a series of submissions and the information from /r/buildapcsales that pass the threshold of 85% upvote rating. The post's information will be saved into "savedStats.txt" and the posts that the bot searched through will be saved into "searched_posts.txt".
